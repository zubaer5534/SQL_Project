9. Summary table (part 3): Using the patients admitted through the emergency only, create a frequency table for encounter volume by age group.
```sql
select -- 10 unique group
  distinct(age) 
FROM `zubaer-dataset-project.Hospital_data.Hospital`;

-- 10 unique group in Age
```
```sql
select 
  count(admission_type_id) as emergency_total
FROM `zubaer-dataset-project.Hospital_data.Hospital`
where medical_specialty = 'Emergency/Trauma';

-- Emergency Total 7565 Records
```
```sql
with em_age as 
(
select 
  age,
  count(admission_type_id) as N
FROM `zubaer-dataset-project.Hospital_data.Hospital`
where medical_specialty = 'Emergency/Trauma'
group by age
order by age
),

em_count as
( select
    count(admission_type_id) as em_total
FROM `zubaer-dataset-project.Hospital_data.Hospital`
where medical_specialty = 'Emergency/Trauma'
),

final_table as (
select 
age as Characteristic,
concat(
(cast (N as string)),
'(',
  CONCAT(ROUND(100 * (ea.N / ec.em_total), 1)),'%',
')'
) as N
from em_age as ea
cross join em_count as ec
order by age
)

select * from final_table
union all
select 'Age' as Characteristic, '' as N
order by Characteristic;
```
`Result`
| Characteristic | N           |

10. Business Solution 1: Is there any association between admission type and blood glucose level (A1Cresult)?
- Consider admission type 1, 2, 3 only
- Exclude the cases where A1C result is not available or None
  
```sql
WITH PartA AS (
  SELECT 
    CASE 
      WHEN admission_type_id = 1 THEN 1
      WHEN admission_type_id = 2 THEN 2
      WHEN admission_type_id = 3 THEN 3
    END AS Characteristic,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN A1Cresult = ">7" OR A1Cresult = ">8" THEN 1 END) AS Diabetic,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN A1Cresult = "Norm" THEN 1 END) AS Normal
  FROM `zubaer-dataset-project.Hospital_data.Hospital`
  WHERE A1Cresult <> "None" AND admission_type_id IN (1, 2, 3)
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 1 ASC
),
Total_cal AS (
  SELECT
    COUNT(CASE WHEN A1Cresult = ">7" OR A1Cresult = ">8" THEN 1 END) AS Total_Diabetic,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN A1Cresult = "Norm" THEN 1 END) AS Total_Normal
  FROM `zubaer-dataset-project.Hospital_data.Hospital`
  WHERE A1Cresult <> "None" AND admission_type_id IN (1, 2, 3)
),
PartB AS (
  SELECT
    cast(a.Characteristic AS STRING) AS Characteristic,
    CONCAT(
      CAST(a.Diabetic AS STRING), " (", 
      ROUND(100 * (a.Diabetic / T.Total_Diabetic), 1), "%)"
    ) AS Diabetic,
    CONCAT(
      CAST(a.Normal AS STRING), " (", 
      ROUND(100 * (a.Normal / T.Total_Normal), 1), "%)"
    ) AS Normal
  FROM PartA AS a
  CROSS JOIN Total_cal AS T 
)

SELECT * FROM PartB
UNION ALL
SELECT 'admiss_type' AS Characteristic, ' ' AS Diabetic, ' ' AS Normal
ORDER BY 
  CASE 
    WHEN Characteristic = 'admiss_type' THEN 0
    WHEN Characteristic = '1' THEN 1
    WHEN Characteristic = '2' THEN 2
    WHEN Characteristic = '3' THEN 3
  END;
```

`Result`

11. Business Question 2:Are there patients admitted through the emergency, having A1C results 8 or more who expired(died)?
 ```sql
